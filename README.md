### PROGRESSION 2 |  STORE ACTION REDUCER
In this progression, you should create a redux store to store the state. Then create the action for the particular event to happen and based on the action create the reducer.

### PROGRESSION 3 | GET N STORE
In this progression, the data what you fetch in the form should be sent to redux store. Fetch the data from the store and display it back in `Display` Component. 

**Do not use hooks or this.state**.

Please refer the output below:
